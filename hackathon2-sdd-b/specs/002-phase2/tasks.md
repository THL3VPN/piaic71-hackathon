# Phase II Tasks

Use this checklist to track Phase II execution. Keep tasks small, testable, and reversible.

- [ ] T001 Finalize REST contracts in `/specs/002-phase2/api/rest-endpoints.md` (payloads, statuses, errors)
- [ ] T002 Finalize database schema in `/specs/002-phase2/database/schema.md` (types, constraints, indexes)
- [ ] T003 Expand feature specs in `/specs/002-phase2/features/*.md` (auth + task CRUD edge cases)
- [ ] T004 Expand UI specs in `/specs/002-phase2/ui/pages.md` and `/specs/002-phase2/ui/components.md`
- [ ] T005 Backend scaffolding (FastAPI + SQLModel, `uv`) aligned to specs
- [ ] T006 Frontend scaffolding (Next.js App Router, Tailwind, Better Auth) aligned to specs
- [ ] T007 Implement authentication flow (Better Auth + JWT validation) per specs
- [ ] T008 Implement task CRUD endpoints with isolation per specs
- [ ] T009 Implement frontend task flows (list/create/edit/delete/complete) per specs
- [ ] T010 Add tests and coverage checks per plan (backend + frontend where applicable)
