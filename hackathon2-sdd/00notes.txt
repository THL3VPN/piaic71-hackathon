    Feature Lifecycle
        Specify - Write down what you want to build (in plain English)
        Clarify (Optional) - Let the AI ask questions to understand better
        Plan - Create a technical plan with data models and interfaces
        ADR - Document important decisions (stored in history/adr/)
        Tasks - Break the plan into small, doable tasks
        Analyze (Optional) - Check that documentation is complete
        Implement - Let the AI build the features
        PHR - Your conversations are automatically saved in history/prompts/ organized by feature and stage
        Test & Merge - Test everything and merge to main branch

    Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement.

    Key Learning: In vibe coding, you created each operation with a separate prompt. In SDD, you group related functionality into ONE feature, then break it into small tasks during planning. This teaches you the difference between FEATURES (user-facing) and TASKS (implementation steps).

    Phase 1: Specify
    Phase 2: Plan
    Phase 3: Tasks
    Phase 4: Implement

    /sp.constitution
        Project principles and standards:
        - Write tests first (TDD approach)
        - Use Python 3.12+ with type hints everywhere
        - Keep code clean and easy to read
        - Document important decisions with ADRs
        - Follow essential OOP principles: SOLID, DRY, KISS

        Technical stack:
        - Python 3.12+ with UV package manager
        - pytest for testing
        - Keep all project files in git

        Quality requirements:
        - All tests must pass
        - At least 80% code coverage
        - Use dataclasses for data structures
    
    Show me the generated constitution file and explain what it contains.
    Use the agent to commit and open a PR for the constitution: /sp.git.commit_pr Commit and push the constitution along with current work.
